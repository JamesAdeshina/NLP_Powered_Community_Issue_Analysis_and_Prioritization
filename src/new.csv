"Dear Council, I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the consistently overflowing trash bins on Elm Street in Leeds. Over the past few months, the bins have rarely been emptied in a timely manner, resulting in unpleasant odours and attracting pests to the area. On several occasions, the situation has escalated to unsanitary conditions that affect the wellbeing of local residents. Despite previous reports submitted in November 2022, little has been done to address this issue. The lack of regular maintenance is a serious problem that undermines our quality of life.

"Dear Council, I am writing to express my concern about the lack of adequate street lighting on Green Lane, Nottingham. Over the past few months, residents have experienced unsafe conditions due to poorly lit streets during the evening hours.
