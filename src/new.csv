The newly resurfaced lanes and prompt pothole repairs have greatly enhanced my daily commute. Since the council began their work in February 2023, the roads have been noticeably smoother, and the enhanced signage has significantly improved safety for both drivers and pedestrians. I was particularly impressed by the swift response to minor issues and the regular updates provided by the maintenance teams. This initiative has not only improved road safety but also boosted community morale. I kindly request that the council continue with these high standards and extend similar efforts to other areas in our district.

"Dear Council, I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the consistently overflowing trash bins on Elm Street in Leeds. Over the past few months, the bins have rarely been emptied in a timely manner, resulting in unpleasant odours and attracting pests to the area. On several occasions, the situation has escalated to unsanitary conditions that affect the wellbeing of local residents. Despite previous reports submitted in November 2022, little has been done to address this issue. The lack of regular maintenance is a serious problem that undermines our quality of life.

Over the past few weeks, the bins have frequently been left unemptied, leading to a buildup of rubbish that mars the appearance of our neighbourhood and poses health risks due to attracting rodents and insects.

"Dear Council, I am writing to express my concern about the lack of adequate street lighting on Green Lane, Nottingham. Over the past few months, residents have experienced unsafe conditions due to poorly lit streets during the evening hours.

I look forward to prompt remedial action on this pressing issue. Thank you for your attention. Yours sincerely, Mark T.","Negative"

"Dear Council, I am writing to bring to your notice the issue of flooding that has affected residential areas in our community, particularly on Riverbank Road, Cambridge.

"Dear Council, I am writing to express my frustration regarding the current state of the recycling campaign in our community, particularly on Cedar Road, Glasgow. Despite repeated calls for improved recycling services, the existing system appears poorly managed and underfunded. Recycling bins are frequently left uncollected, and there is a lack of clear guidance on waste segregation. This inefficiency not only hampers our efforts to reduce waste but also contributes negatively to the local environment.

Immediate measures to improve collection frequency and public education on recycling are essential. I look forward to seeing tangible improvements soon. Sincerely, Laura M.","Negative"
