Dear Council Member,
I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the deteriorating condition of our local roads. Over the past several months, the once smooth surfaces of Main Road and its adjoining lanes have developed numerous potholes and cracks. The recent heavy rains have worsened these conditions by causing water to accumulate in the damaged areas, making travel hazardous for both drivers and pedestrians. The current state of our roads not only poses significant safety risks but also affects the overall image of our community and hampers local business activities.
I urge the Bolsover District Council to undertake a comprehensive survey of the affected areas and to allocate the necessary resources for prompt repairs and long-term maintenance. A scheduled maintenance plan would help prevent further deterioration and ensure that our infrastructure remains safe and reliable. In addition, clearer communication regarding repair schedules would help residents plan their travels better.
I trust that you will treat this matter with the urgency it deserves and take immediate steps to improve road safety in our area. Your prompt action will be greatly appreciated by all community members who rely on these roads daily.
Yours faithfully,

Dear Waste Management Team,
I am writing to bring to your attention the recurring issue of overflowing trash bins in our local area.

This issue not only mars the appearance of our streets but also poses a health risk, especially to vulnerable community members.
I respectfully request that the Bolsover District Council review and adjust the current waste collection timetable. Increasing the frequency of collections and adding additional bins in strategic locations would help address this persistent problem. Enhanced public awareness campaigns on proper waste disposal could further support these efforts.
I trust that you will give this matter your prompt attention so that our community environment may be restored to a higher standard.
