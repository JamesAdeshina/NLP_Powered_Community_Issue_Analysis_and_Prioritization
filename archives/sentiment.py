Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the deteriorating air quality in Birmingham. 
Over the past few months, the city has experienced a significant increase in smog and industrial emissions, 
which I believe is severely affecting public health. I have observed that the polluted air is causing respiratory 
issues among residents, particularly vulnerable groups such as the elderly and children. I urge the council to undertake 
immediate measures, including stricter emissions controls and increased monitoring, to mitigate this hazardous situation. 
Your prompt action in addressing this matter would be greatly appreciated.

The councilâ€™s failure to effectively address this issue is unacceptable. Immediate action is required, including stricter emissions controls and better monitoring, to prevent further harm. It is extremely frustrating that this matter has not been prioritized.
